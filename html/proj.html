                        The world is improving every day, inventing and discovering something new, and without these achievements we would not have made it that far. Scientists, researchers, developers and designers from all over the world are trying to implement what will make our life easier and more interesting.

                    Probably everyone watched the Marvel movie "Iron Man". The first part of it was released in 2008, and then it seemed inconceivable for even most of the planet to have a voice on the phone that can answer your commands, find the necessary information or suggest where you can have coffee with friends in an unfamiliar city. But miraculously, Siri appears on the iPhone in 2011. Now we are no longer surprised by the ability of Jarvis to serve Tony Stark, analyze his systems and so on. Nowadays, so many virtual assistants are available to mankind that it is almost impossible to remember all of them: Siri, Alice, Alexa, Cortana and others.

                    Foldable technology is found in many modern films about the future. Why? They are comfortable to carry, they are small, they can perform many functions at the same time, and in general they look incredible.
                    Until a few years ago, it was difficult to imagine multiple cameras on a smartphone body, but now we can freely fold the display of Motorola Razr, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip and Galaxy Fold in half.
                    The first Galaxy Fold hit the market in 2019. Of course, Samsung was not alone in the design and development of flexible displays. We can't ignore Royole, which develops entire flexible suvoys, and at CES 2020 unveiled a tree from their flexible displays.

                    Previously, watching holograms of the next gathering of a secret organization or a Jedi council in Star Wars was simply unimaginable. Well, where can you imagine, see a person in flesh and blood, right in front of you, touch him, talk, and then he just disappeared, as if nothing had happened? Before the advent of technology, philosophers believed that virtual reality is a state that does not exist, but it can arise when a person enters a commune or in a dream.
                    In addition, with the help of virtual reality, time travel becomes much more real. For example, you don't need to invent a special machine to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the Jurassic period. All you need for this now: a special program and a virtual reality helmet.

I'm sure everyone remembers the red-haired Leela performed by Mila Jovovich and the amazing technologies that were presented in the film. Flying taxis? Cars capable of being driven by autopilot were already too much for a person born in the 20th century. However, now we have both. It took us a long time to make it a reality. Hundreds of plots of films about the future affected world progress and, in the end, the Pioneer PAL-V Liberty flying car appeared on the market. A vehicle capable of climbing 4 km in height and reaching speeds in the air up to 321 km / h. By the way, it is available for pre-order in Ukraine for only 547 thousand dollars.

                    After watching the series "Black Mirror" and the movie "Oblivion" it seems that humanity has not gone that far yet. Nevertheless, after opening the news and reading about another attempt by artificial intelligence to find a cure for a new virus or printing houses, transplanting artificial organs, and you catch yourself thinking: "This is the future!" The first 3D printer appeared back in 1983. Then this technology was not particularly interested, because it seemed too futuristic. Who needs a printer to print houses when they can just be built? People did not attach importance to the new technology, but there were dreamers such as Charles Hull, who founded his company and received a patent for it.

                    At the end of this year, scientists from the Netherlands are to complete work on a section of the quantum Internet, linking the cities of Delft and The Hague with new technology. After successful testing, the network will be expanded to four cities.
                    Based on quantum physics, the Internet will provide significantly more secure communications. It is assumed that at the current level of technology, it cannot be hacked. Today, hacking of communications on the Internet is one of the biggest problems.
                    Work on the quantum Internet has been going on for many years, for example, in China, a quantum communication channel has been created between Beijing and Shanghai, which is 2000 kilometers apart.

                    Financial privacy could improve in the coming years, and digital money will help it. Today, people in the world are abandoning paper money, which makes it more difficult to buy and sell without the involvement of a financial intermediary. With digital money, direct transfers of amounts from one account to another become possible.
                    The social network Facebook is planning to launch digital money, which announced work on the Libra currency. Also, China may become one of the first big economies to launch its digital currency. The People's Bank of China (the country's central bank) is exploring the possibility of launching its digital currency and is considering it as a substitute for paper money.

                    Traditional computers on silicon chips have reached their limits and the industry is awaiting a new breakthrough, which should be a quantum computer. It processes data in a completely different way, storing it in qubits, thanks to which it is able to solve complex problems that would take centuries for classical silicon computers.
                    It is expected that quantum computers will allow breaking modern cryptography, as well as simulating the exact behavior of molecules, which will lead to the discovery of new drugs and materials.
                    Companies today strive to achieve leadership in the field of quantum computers. They are being developed by Google, IBM, Microsoft, Rigetti, D-Wave, IonQ, Zapata Computing, Quantum Circuits.

                    Superfast 5G Internet

                    Google is working on solar-powered drones that serve up ultra-fast internet in a project called Project Skybender. In theory, drones will provide Internet services 40 times faster than 4G networks, allowing them to transfer gigabytes of data per second.
                    The project envisages the use of millimeter waves to provide the service, since the existing spectrum for mobile communication is too full. However, these waves have a shorter range than the 4G mobile signal. Google is working on this problem, and if all the technical problems can be solved, the Internet of unprecedented speed may soon appear.

                    5D Storage discs
                </div>
                <div class="popup10MainText">
                    Researchers have created a 5D disc that records data in 5 dimensions that persist for billions of years. It can store 360 ​​terabytes of data and withstand temperatures up to 1000 degrees.
                    The files on the disk are made of three layers of nanodots. The five dimensions of the disc relate to the size and orientation of the points, as well as their position within the three dimensions. When light passes through the disc, the dots change the polarization of the light, which is read by the microscope and polarizer.
                    The Southampton team that is developing the disc has been able to record the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Newton's Optics, Magna Carta and the Bible on the disc. In a few years, such a disk will no longer be an experiment, but will become the norm for data storage.
